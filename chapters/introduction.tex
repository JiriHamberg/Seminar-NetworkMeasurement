%\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} the introduction. Motivation, history and the current state of the research is discussed here.

\IEEEPARstart{T}{CP} is one of the protocols of the Internet protocol suite, providing reliable transmission of data. A large portion of the Internet's traffic is transferred using TCP. Therefore trying to optimize the efficiency of the protocol for various environments and physical mediums is a active field of research.

The two main tools for evaluating TCP are analytical models and network measurements. In this paper, we give a concise introduction to measurement based methods for evaluating and improving TCP.
