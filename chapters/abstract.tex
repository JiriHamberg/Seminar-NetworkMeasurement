In this paper, we explore different ways in which measurements play a role in TCP experiments, based on existing literature. We look at metrics, parameters and measurement platforms that should be considered when designing a TCP experiment. We give an overview of a study which used active measurements to improve TCP start up performance as well as another study, which used a network simulations to evaluate the performance of three widely adopted TCP variants: New Reno, Compound and Cubic in different network setups.
