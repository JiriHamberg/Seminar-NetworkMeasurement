Measurements that affect the decisions made by a node in the network. TCP itself relies on active measurements, such as tracking RTT:s of segments.

\subsection{Improving TCP Startup Performance}
Illustrate, based on existing literature, how active tracking of TCP segments can be used to improve TCP slow start performance. 

Alternatively this subsection could be a separate section.
