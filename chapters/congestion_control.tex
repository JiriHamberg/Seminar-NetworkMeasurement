In this section, we will be looking at a work by I. Abdeljaouad et al.~\cite{Abdeljaouad10}, where the performance of three modern TCP variants, Cubic, Compound and New Reno, were compared using ns2 network simulator~\cite{Singh12}. We will start by quickly introducing each of the three TCP variants followed by a summary of the experiment and analysis conducted by I. Abdeljaouad et al.

\subsection{Cubic}

Cubic is the default TCP implementation of Linux kernels from version 2.6.19 onwards. The congestion window of Cubic is determined by the following function

\[
W_{cubic}(t) = C(t - K)^3 + W_{max}   
\]

where $C$ is a scale factor, $t$ is the time since last congestion window reduction, $W_{max}$ is the window size before last congestion window reduction and $K = (W_{max} \beta / C)^{1 / 3}$, where $\beta$ is the fractional reduction applied to $W_{max}$ during the last reduction~\cite{Ha08}. 

\subsection{Compound}
 
\subsection{New Reno}
